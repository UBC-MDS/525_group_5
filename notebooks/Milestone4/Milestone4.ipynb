Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "1. Setup an EC2 instance. Make sure you add a rule in security groups to accept `All TCP` connections from `Anywhere`. SSH into your EC2 instance from milestone2.\n",

    "    2.1 You can use the Linux editor using ```vi```. More details on vi Editor [here](https://www.guru99.com/the-vi-editor.html). Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc. You can copy code from your jupyter and paste it into `app.py`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/app.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance. You want to configure your S3 for this. Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "    4.1. (Additional help) you can install the required packages inside your terminal.\n",

    "5. Now you're ready to start your service, go ahead and run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`. This will make your service available at your EC2 instance's `Public IPv4 address` on port 8080. Please ensure that you run this from where ```app.py``` and ```model.joblib``` reside.\n",
    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances `public IPv4 address` append with `:8080` into a browser, so something like `http://Public IPv4 address:8080`. From step 4, you might notice that flask output saying \"Running on http://XXXX:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\", where XXXX is `Private IPv4 address`, and you want to replace it with the `Public IPv4 address`\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    ">EG: curl -X POST http://your_EC2_ip:8080/predict -d '{\"data\":[1,2,3,4,53,11,22,37,41,53,11,24,31,44,53,11,22,35,42,53,12,23,31,42,53]}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service?\n",
    "9. We could use several options to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try reaccessing your service with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",
    "13. ***CONGRATULATIONS!!!*** You have successfully got to the end of our milestones. Move to Task 3 and submit it."

    "\n",
    "**Milestone 1**: We worked with a large dataset and recorded the time taken and memory used at each step on our personal computers. To reduce the time and memory usage, we used other optimization techniques such as \"converting numerical columns from float64 to float32\" and \"loading individual columns\" while doing the EDA. Our conclusion was that the M1 chip performed 1.5 times faster compared to the IntelCorei5 chip. Finally, to reduce the time and memory required, we explored different ways of saving a big data set by using the parquet and feather format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Milestone 2**: Handling large files becomes a hassle when working on our local system. As such, we were introduced to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here we set up an EC2 instance along with JupyterHub, loaded the required packages and added users to it. We then set up a S3 bucket to store our files. We used the bucket to read and write our files. Finally, we carried out EDA and wrangling of our dataset which we used in Milestone 1. This took significantly less time. Our final product in this milestone was stored in the S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Milestone 3**: In this milestone, we performed machine learning tasks. Since there is a limit to how much we can scale vertically, we scale horizontally by setting up an EMR cluster along with Spark, Hadoop, Jupyterhub along with the packages required. We performed EDA and used random forest regression on both the overall and individual models. Finally, we tuned the overall model, and adjusted several hyperparameters, including the max depth and the number of estimators. This model was stored in our S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Milestone 4**: In this milestone, we deployed the model that we saved in the previous milestone and build the API using Flask. We stored the code in the bucket so that we could use it to perform both the reading and writing tasks and store it in the bucket. After which, we created screen sessions to keep the API from stopping even if the user is offline. The API can now run without Flask."
